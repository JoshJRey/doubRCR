# doubRCR
Scripts for the identification of doubletons who are reciprocal closest relatives (RCR) from population genomic data. These scripts are designed to run off of unphased VCF.

## Setup
The framework for haplotype identification uses the repository associated with Mathieson and McVean's 2014 publication "Demography and the age of rare variants". To start, one will want to clone and setup their repo, found here. Please ensure to also cite their work (reference provided below).

## Scripts
This directory contains scripts for the identification of haplotypes, linked rare variants, and RCR doubleton classification. More information can be found in the readme in /scripts.

## Simulations

This directory contains scripts used for simulations to test the effectiveness of our approach to identifying RCR doubletons. Much of this process is the same 
as for empirical data. More information can be found in the readme in /simulations.
