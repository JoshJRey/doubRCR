# doubRCR
Scripts for the identification of doubletons who are reciprocal closest relatives (RCR) from population genomic data.


## Simulations

This directory contains scripts used for simulations to test the effectiveness of our approach to identifying RCR doubletons. Much of this process is the same 
as for empirical data. More information can be found in the readme in /simulations.
